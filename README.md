# battleship

This is the Battleship project of the javascript module in The Odin Project

## Final project link

The project is available [here](https://webpack.js.org/guides/getting-started/).

## Side objectives

Aside from the functionality, personal goals in completing this work include:

- Before the project, further develop the template-web-app as a better starting point, incorporating jest
- Apply unit testing for the first time in a project
- Apply improved version control through git, using rebase, reset, etc.
- Focus on SOLID single responsibility and on building pure functions wherever possible / appropriate
- Develop a more web-like UI, not tieing the page down as much as in previous Odin Projects
